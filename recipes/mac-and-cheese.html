      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>1 (16 ounce) package elbow macaroni</li>
         <li>1 rotisserie-roasted chicken</li>
         <li>6 tablespoons butter</li>
         <li>6 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
         <li>3 cups milk</li>
         <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
         <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
         <li>2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
         <li>1/2 cup hot sauce, or more to taste</li>
         <li>1/2 cup crumbled gorgonzola cheese</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
         <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
         <li>Cut wings and legs off rotisserie chicken. Remove skin and bones from wings and legs; chop or shred dark meat into bite-sized pieces.</li>
         <li>Melt butter in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Gradually whisk in flour until a thick paste forms. Cook until golden, about 1 minute. Pour in milk, whisking constantly, until thickened and bubbling, about 5 minutes. Continue to cook and stir until sauce is smooth, about 1 minute more. Reduce heat and season with pepper.</li>
         <li>Stir Cheddar and Monterey Jack into the sauce until melted and combined. Stir in hot sauce to the desired level of spiciness. Add Gorgonzola, chicken, and macaroni; mix well to combine.</li>
      </ol>
